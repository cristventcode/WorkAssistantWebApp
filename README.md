## Work Assitant Web App
I am creating this web application to personally assist me at my current job. 
Successful implementation of this app should...

- reduce the amount of time spent walking around
- reduce the dependency of keeping track of things on paper
- keeping a running record of products I have stocked
- assist me in pulling information about products on my stock schedule
- generate a printable report of my daily tasks and stocking schedule

First version of this web app will be to assist myself only. 

Future expansions will consider adding user and admin levels for multiple users. 

An agile development approach will aid in allowing for possible modifications during development. 

### Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, C#, Visual Studio, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, SQL, Agile Development
